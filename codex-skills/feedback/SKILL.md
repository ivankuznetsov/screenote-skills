# Feedback — Retrieve Visual Annotations

You are executing the Feedback skill. This retrieves human annotations from Screenote so you can act on visual feedback.

Authentication is handled automatically via OAuth 2.1 — the plugin's `.mcp.json` configures the MCP server connection. No API key needed.

## Argument Parsing

Before Step 1, normalize the argument:

1. If the first whitespace-separated token is exactly `desktop`, `tablet`, or `mobile`, consume it as the **viewport filter** for Step 3 and pass the *remainder* (possibly empty) as the page/version hint for Step 2.
2. Otherwise, the viewport filter is unset and the full argument is the page/version hint.

Examples:
- `/feedback` → viewport: none, hint: none
- `/feedback login` → viewport: none, hint: `login`
- `/feedback desktop` → viewport: `desktop`, hint: none
- `/feedback desktop login` → viewport: `desktop`, hint: `login`

Never match a viewport keyword against page names — that collision is the reason for the split above.

## Step 1: Resolve Project

Follow the **Project Cache** and **Pick a Project** procedure from the `$screenote:screenote` skill (`codex-skills/screenote/SKILL.md`). The logic is identical: call `list_projects` first (auth gate), then check `.screenote/screenote-cache.json` with legacy `.claude/screenote-cache.json` fallback, match by local project name, or prompt the user.

If `list_projects` returned zero projects → say:
  "No Screenote projects found. Capture a page first with `$screenote:screenote <url>`." Stop.

## Step 2: Pick a Page and Version

If the **page/version hint** (from Argument Parsing above) is non-empty, use it as a case-insensitive selection hint when matching page names and version titles below. Auto-select only when there is exactly one clear match; otherwise fall back to interactive picking.

Call `list_pages` with project_id.
- Zero pages → "No screenshots in this project yet. Use `/screenote <url>` to capture a page first." Stop.
- One page → use it automatically
- Multiple pages → if the argument uniquely matches one page name, use it; otherwise show pages by name (with version count), let user pick

Call `list_screenshots` with project_id and page_id.
- Zero versions → "No screenshot versions found for this page yet. Capture one with `/screenote <url>` first." Stop.
- One version → use it
- Multiple → if the argument uniquely matches one version title, use it; otherwise show by title, let user pick

## Step 3: Fetch Annotations

Call `list_annotations` with project_id, screenshot_id, status: "open".

If the **viewport filter** was set in Argument Parsing, pass `viewport: <keyword>` as well so only annotations drawn against that layout come back.

If zero annotations → say:
  "No open annotations for this screenshot. Open the annotate URL to add feedback, or check if annotations are marked as resolved." Include annotate_url if available. Stop.

## Step 4: Get Visual Context

For each annotation, call `get_annotation` to retrieve the cropped image of the annotated region. The crop is pulled from the ScreenshotImage that matches `annotation.viewport` — so a mobile annotation shows the mobile-layout crop, not the desktop one.

## Step 5: Present Feedback

Header: "Feedback for **<project_name>** — <page_name> — <version_title>"

If annotations span multiple viewports, group them under subheadings: "Desktop (2 open)", "Tablet (1 open)", "Mobile (3 open)". Within a single-viewport response, a subheading is not needed.

For each annotation, show:
- Viewport label — "Desktop", "Tablet", or "Mobile" (Title Case, matching the subheading form above; layouts differ so this needs to be explicit)
- Type (point/region) with coordinates
- Author
- Comment text
- Cropped image (from the matching viewport's ScreenshotImage)

## Step 6: Fix and Respond

After presenting all annotations, ask the user what to do:
- **Fix a specific annotation** (and comment + resolve when done)
- **Fix all annotations** one by one, optionally scoped to one viewport ("let's fix mobile first")
- **Reply without fixing** (leave a comment explaining why, then resolve)
- **Take a new screenshot** after making fixes (`/screenote <url>`)

For each annotation being addressed:

1. **Fix the code** (if a code change is needed)
2. **Post a reply comment** explaining what was done:
   - Call `add_annotation_comment` with `project_id`, `annotation_id`, and a `body` describing the fix (all three are required)
   - Comment format: describe what was changed and where, e.g. `Fixed: adjusted button color. Changed: src/components/Button.tsx:42 — updated background color from red to blue`
   - For "won't fix" / "by design" cases, explain the reasoning instead, e.g. `Won't fix: the button is intentionally disabled for free-tier users`
3. **Resolve the annotation**:
   - Call `resolve_annotation` with `project_id`, `annotation_id`, and a brief `comment` (e.g., "Fixed" or "Won't fix — see reply")
4. **Handle failures by error class** — don't blindly continue:
   - **401 / 403 (auth)**: stop. Show the error, tell the developer to re-authenticate. Do NOT call `resolve_annotation` (it would resolve with no audit trail).
   - **422 (validation)**: show the error, adjust the `body`, retry the comment.
   - **5xx / network**: retry once. If still failing, surface the error and stop — don't resolve without the explanatory comment.
   - **If `resolve_annotation` itself fails**: report the error verbatim, do not retry silently.
